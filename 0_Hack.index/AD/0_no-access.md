State
- You have no internal access yet OR you just landed in the network.
- You need to identify hosts, services, and whether AD exists.

Goal → Discover services, confirm AD, identify first footholds.

### IF YOU SEE:

If you see port 88 (Kerberos) →
    → AD confirmed → Move to 1_anon-access  
    → Review: [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/3_Exploitation/Active Directory/Active Directory Background]]

If you see port 389/636 (LDAP) →
    → Try anon bind later (in 1_anon-access)  
    → Note LDAP server hostnames for AD mapping

If you see port 445 (SMB) →
    → Check anonymous/null session later  
    → Useful: SMB often visible even before other AD indicators

If scanning shows Windows hosts or DNS names like *.local / *.corp / *.internal →
    → Likely AD domain → Note naming conventions  
    → Check: [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/1_Reconnaissance/Investigating Email Addresses]]

If HTTP/HTTPS banners reference SharePoint, Outlook, OWA, Teams, or Azure AD →
    → Strong AD presence  
    → Confirm by enumerating the infrastructure

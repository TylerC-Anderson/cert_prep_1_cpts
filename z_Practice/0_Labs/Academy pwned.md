## Box: [Academy] — Started: 2025-10-16 20:10

**IP/Host:** VM Mac ADDR `00:0c:29:e8:fc:4c`  |  **Status:** `In-Progress`
**Session 1 IP**: 192.168.109.131
**Session 2 IP**: 192.168.109.132
**Session 3 IP**: 192.168.109.134

### TL;DR

**NOTE**: This is an intentionally vulnerable machine, so I'm treating this as though it were a CTF. As such, data from the machine will be included in this writeup, and I will also do things I normally wouldn't do in an engagement (such as change a student's password!)

Initial: `reverse shell script on vulnerable file uploader function`. PrivEsc: `reverse shell one liner on vulnerable a cron job script`.

*Cumulative Impact Overview*:
- data exfil on unsecured site
- User access and disruption

### Exploit Lifecycle

1. *Validation & Recon*: Local VM vulnbox
2. *Enumeration & Scanning*:
    - `nmap -sV`
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.109.131
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-10-16 20:50 EDT

```

Basically two lines of investigation so far-- notable that ssh is a possible third, but inefficient, so let's try the two easier once first.

##### Website first

- Open 80 -> website hosted by Apache. Navigating in browser to web address finds a default Apache page.

Hello Heath !
Grimmie has setup the test website for the new academy.
I told him not to use the same password everywhere, he will change it ASAP.


I couldn't create a user via the admin panel, so instead I inserted directly into the database with the following command:

INSERT INTO `students` (`StudentRegno`, `studentPhoto`, `password`, `studentName`, `pincode`, `session`, `department`, `semester`, `cgpa`, `creationdate`, `updationDate`) VALUES
('10201321', '', 'cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8', 'Rum Ham', '777777', '', '', '', '7.60', '2021-05-29 14:36:56', '');

The StudentRegno number is what you use for login.


Le me know what you think of this open-source project, it's from 2020 so it should be secure... right ?
We can always adapt it to our needs.

-jdelta

```

back to `/academy` webpage
- Student named "Rum Ham" might have a login at RegNo:pw of 10201321:cd73502828457d15655bbd7a63fb0bc8
    - password is likely a hash, trying it in the webpage confirms it as it does not login using the literal string. Will try `john` next. Looks like an MD5 so...
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-md5 crackthis.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8

Use the "--show --format=Raw-MD5" options to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 

```
- Login success! creating a new password for a student... thxforlettingmein

On `/phpmyadmin` none of the above lets us in, so I'm attempting a `burpsuite` password attack with `grimmie`, since he seems to use insecure passwords according to `note.txt`.

- After attempting this I realized that the web app was redirecting to `phpmyadmin/index.php`, and it was obtaining a session cookie from `phpmyadmin` that was being used for auth. I could have done a two stage attack (where I first have `burpsuite` get the session cookie from `phpmyadmin` then attempt to bruteforce a login to `phpmyadmin/index.php` using the session cookie). But I don't have burpsuite pro, which would have been necessary to use macros from what I could see, so this would have been an inefficient lift.
 
I decided to pivot to a hydra attack to bruteforce `grimmie`'s password on SSH, since I had a username, but this also did not work.

Then I looked at what I knew, and decided I knew how to get into `academy` for sure, so maybe I could re-enumerate passing in the password and REGNO as the username in `gobuster`

```bash
gobuster dir -U 10201321 -P thxforlettingmein -u http://192.168.109.131/academy -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

- `academy/admin` didn't work, because the student I was logging in as wasn't an admin. However `academy/db` yielded their SQL db which has a listing for the admin's password hash

4. *PrivEsc*:
```bash
INSERT INTO `admin` (`id`, `username`, `password`, `creationDate`, `updationDate`) VALUES
(1, 'admin', '21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3', '2020-01-24 16:21:18', '03-06-2020 07:09:07 PM')

- admin:admin into `academy/admin` from the second round of enum got us to the online course admin panel
![[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - CPTS/z_Practice/0_Labs/z_attachments/Pasted image 20251017000737.png|500]]

- in the `admin` panel, attempting to reset Rum Ham's password shows the url in the browser tools uses a script that's called after the query operator:
http://192.168.109.131/academy/admin/manage-students.php?id=10201321&pass=update
- In the `admin` panel the majority of the tabs in the webapp don't seem to do much, but `/session` and `/department` accepts input that seems to get into the DB. This seems potentially vulnerable to SQL injection

Trying `sqlmap`:
```bash

```

- Valid SQLi payload: sesssion=' AND (SELECT 7947 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))tKIo) AND 'LbYK'='LbYK
    - worked for both `/session` and `department`

At this point I started wondering if I was overcomplicating this, which would usually be when I look to a senior engineer for point in the right direction, so in my case I looked to a walkthrough. I thought working from the `admin` panel would have been the best way to continue to escalate or get a shell, however the walkthrough showed me that using the photo upload feature in `/academy` (non-admin panel) allowed for code exec, which if uploading a php reverse shell script allows you to connect and get a reverse shell.

Here is how that was done:
- paste code from https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell to a shell script: `└─$ nano payloads/phprvshell.php` 
    - Ensure code is pointed at correct IPADDR and port for you, and other options are satisfied
- start nc listener on attack box for port and IP addr (see [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/3_Exploitation/Gaining Shell Access]] for more details)
- upload shell script to vuln app, like you would in the below screenshot by clicking `browse` > `update`:
![[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - CPTS/z_Practice/0_Labs/z_attachments/Pasted image 20251018181558.png|500]]

- Reverse shell should have started on `netcat` listener you set up:
```bash
└─$ nc -nvlp 1234               
listening on [any] 1234 ...

```

- From there we uploaded [[2_Studies/Courses/Current/CERTPREP - PJPT-Practical Jr Pen Tester/Practical Ethical Hacking/4_Privilege_Escalation/LinPEAS, WinPEAS, & SharPEAS|linpeas]] ran it, and got this useful output out of it:
```bash
==MYSQL PWD==

/var/www/html/academy/admin/includes/config.php:$mysql_password = "My_V3ryS3cur3_P4ss";
/var/www/html/academy/includes/config.php:$mysql_password = "My_V3ryS3cur3_P4ss";

Linpeas potential escalation vector:
* * * * * /home/grimmie/backup.sh
```

- outputting the contents of the `config.php` from above gives us:
```bash
$ cat /var/www/html/academy/admin/includes/config.php
<?php
$mysql_hostname = "localhost";
$mysql_user = "grimmie";
$mysql_password = "My_V3ryS3cur3_P4ss";
$mysql_database = "onlinecourse";
$bd = mysqli_connect($mysql_hostname, $mysql_user, $mysql_password, $mysql_database) or die("Could not connect database");
?>
```

- since `grimmie` reuses pws we know that `My_V3ryS3cur3_P4ss` is likely the same to ssh in as him. Sure enough...

### Findings

- _Found_: 80 - 192.168.109.131 - 2025-10-16 21:12:27 - Default Apache page served (`It works!`) — default vhost present; server reachable; potential fingerprinting/info exposure.
- *Found*: 21 - 192.168.109.131 - 2025-10-16 21:31:55 - FTP, while a non-vulnerable version, does allow for anonymous login. -> `note.txt` is downloadable anonymously, and is sensitive data exposure
    - *Found*: 21 -> 80 - 192.168.109.131/academy - 2025-10-16 22:00:19 - Was allowed access to student's account and ability to change their password
- *Found*: 80 - 192.168.109.131/academy/db - 2025-10-17 00:02:29 - unrestricted access to SQL db named `onlinecourse.sql`, which contains admin's password hash
- *Found*: 80 - 192.168.109.131/academy/admin - 2025-10-17 00:33:34 - Bad admin credentials (default admin credentials)
- *Found*: 80 - 192.168.109.134/academy - 2025-10-18 19:50:44 - Unsanitized file uploader in Student Photo feature of webapp allows for remote code execution, such as reverse shell which was successfully used for initial access
- *Found*: 22 - 192.168.109.134 - 2025-10-18 19:49:19 - Admin password reuse and unencrypted/permissive password file allows for wide access to system and SSH after initial reverse shell exploitation
- *Found*: 192.168.109.134 - 2025-10-18 19:49:06 - `www-data` user is able to change file permissions itself, which allows for further exploitation if shell access is gained. `www-data` user should instead call on a different, higher level user which authenticates the action to disallow file uploads and created files to be ran, which is an escaltion vector that was successfully exploited to gain access to the `grimmie` user
